## Stripe

Use Stripe CLI to simulate Stripe events in your local environment. Note this does create products/subscritions in th cloud but in Stripe's test environment.

1. `stripe login`
2. `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhook`
3. Trigger events with CLI https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types

## Logging

Import the logger from `src/config/logger.js`. It is using the [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logging library.

Logging should be done according to the following severity levels (ascending order from most important to least important):

```javascript
const logger = require('<path to src>/config/logger');

logger.error('message'); // level 0
logger.warn('message'); // level 1
logger.info('message'); // level 2
logger.http('message'); // level 3
logger.verbose('message'); // level 4
logger.debug('message'); // level 5
```

In development mode, log messages of all severity levels will be printed to the console.

In production mode, only `info`, `warn`, and `error` logs will be printed to the console.\
It is up to the server (or process manager) to actually read them from the console and store them in log files.\
This app uses pm2 in production mode, which is already configured to store the logs in log files.

Note: API request information (request url, response code, timestamp, etc.) are also automatically logged (using [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)).
